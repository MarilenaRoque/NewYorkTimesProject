            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
            understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what
            might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing
            the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
            prodigiously violent instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would
            solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
            iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were
            not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
            the page and drew a double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s
            starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
            beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
            undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching back across 13.8
            billion years to
            <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at
            the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
            Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
            fabric of space-time — so-called
            <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
            being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.
          </p>

          <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>

          <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of
            Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part
            of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued,
            “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
            telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested
            themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
            that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it
            was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr.
            Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
            Astrophysical Journal.

        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in
        10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying
        he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime. “With
        nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth
        of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr.
        Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
        with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979),
        in his office last week. “It was a very special moment, and one we took
        very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as
        carefully as he tended his radio telescopes. Andrei Linde of Stanford, a
        prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
        inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on
        vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford
        colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a
        bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

        Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
        anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that
        this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
        simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
        wrote in an email. Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr.
        Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the
        best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend, as social
        media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
        spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and
        caution. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I
        think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
        discoveries in the history of science.” John E. Carlstrom of the
        University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
        project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
        impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he
        said. Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
        inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
        genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
        but he expressed reservations about inflation. Lawrence M. Krauss of
        Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
        noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
        temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s
        Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe. “So we will
        need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss
        said.Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
        will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
        trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
        and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
        waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series
        of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the
        thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement
        Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California
        Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford. “The South Pole is the
        closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac
        said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve
        been hooked ever since,” he said.

        In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
        radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference
        to vibrate in one direction rather than another. This was a step toward
        the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
        Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in
        another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the
        microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the
        sky should have little arrows going in spirals. Detecting those spirals
        required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature
        of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant
        superconducting thermometer. “We had no expectations what we would see,”
        Dr. Kovac said. The strength of the signal surprised the researchers,
        and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making
        sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them
        to the breakthrough.
      </p>

      <h4>A Special Time</h4>

      <p>
        The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
        Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected
        was a special break point in the evolution of the universe. Physicists
        recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long
        suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
        unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with
        each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
        splitting away. That was where Dr. Guth came in. Under some
        circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls
        below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
        freeze, releasing latent heat. Similarly, the universe could “supercool”
        and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would
        become imbued with a mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s
        equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
        universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
        repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
        to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink. Almost as
        quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
        radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in
        today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of
        light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
        free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the
        ultimate free lunch.” Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so
        models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation,
        once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
        comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
        blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
        multiverse. So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund,
        but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past. We might
        never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
        because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos
        and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of
        our view. “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
        Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind
        up at inflation.”
